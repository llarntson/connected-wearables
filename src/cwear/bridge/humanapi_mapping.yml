#
# The contents of this file describe the data from the Human API that
# we would like to map to device cloud streams.  Some items are not
# passed over and others we need to provide some type/unit hinting.
#
# NOTE: the device cloud has no type for datetime... annoying.  We mark as "datetime" type and
#   will do mapping to string later on.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The batch endpoints are as follows:
#
# /apps/:clientId/users/activities
# /apps/:clientId/users/heart_rates
# /apps/:clientId/users/bmis
# /apps/:clientId/users/body_fats
# /apps/:clientId/users/heights
# /apps/:clientId/users/weights
# /apps/:clientId/users/blood_glucoses
# /apps/:clientId/users/blood_oxygens
# /apps/:clientId/users/sleeps
# /apps/:clientId/users/blood_pressures
# /apps/:clientId/users/genetic_traits    <-- Not modeled at all; doesn't really work as a "stream" of data, ever
# /apps/:clientId/users/locations
